*Blind-OVOTE* is a L2 voting solution which combines the *validity rollup* ideas with *blind signatures over elliptic curves* inside zkSNARK, to provide offchain anonymous voting with onchain binding execution on Ethereum.

The Blind-OVOTE **technical document** can be found at: **https://research.aragon.org/docs/blind-ovote**

> Warning: experimental code, do not use in production.

Blind-OVOTE uses the Schnorr Blind Signatures implemented in https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/ark-ec-blind-signatures
